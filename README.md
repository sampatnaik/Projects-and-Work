# Static RAM Cell Design
This github repository is for the design of a Static RAM (SRAM).

## Introduction to SRAM
SRAM stands for Static Random Access Memory, it is a semiconductor which uses flip-flops to store bit of data. 
Unlike the DRAMs (Dynamic RAMs) which stores bits of data in cells consisting of transisitor and capacitor, SRAMs stores the data as long as power is supplied to the system.
This feature makes the SRAM faster and more expensive per bit as compared to DRAM.
